# Huawei-Codecraft-2018
It's my first time to participate in a data mining competition. The competition is held by Huawei and its total bonus is about $100,000 USD. Our team ranked 34/1515 in the competition at April 15 and ranked 20/36 in the competition at April 27. Final included programs we committed in the live match at April 27. Draft includes programs we wrote since March 14. Doc includes official documents and test data provided by Huawei.
