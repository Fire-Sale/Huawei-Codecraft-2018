# Huawei-Codecraft-2018
It's my first time to participate in a data mining competition. The competition is held by Huawei and its total bonus is about $100,000 USD. Our team ranked 34/1515 in the competition at Apr 15 and ranked 20/36 in the competition at Apr 27 in Southwest Division of China (8 Divisions in total). Final includes programs we committed in the live match at Apr 27. Draft includes programs we commited since Mar 14. Doc includes official documents and test data provided by Huawei. Hope you like it~
